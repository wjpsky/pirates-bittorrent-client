Welcome to the Pirates BitTorrent Client (Java) README file!

The system was developed in a distributed programming project course at the IT
University of Gothenburg. We were supposed to use Erlang for the torrent code.
However, since we could use any other language for the GUI code we choose to
work with Java. We choose Java because it is a imperative language (and thus, in
our opinions, being a better suitable language for graphics than a functional
language). Furthermore, we had previous experience with it and it also gives us
platform independence and easy deployment.

We never got the chance to properly integrate Java with Erlang, as we had to
focus on other core features. However, we provide do mock objects and a GUI.

Check out the Eclipse project from our Google Code page if you want the Eclipse
project which you can build using m2eclipse: "Team > Run As... > Maven package".
